NAME
    Pegex - Pegex Parser Generator

SYNOPSIS
        use Pegex;
        my $data = pegex($grammar)->parse($input);

    or more explicitly:

        use Pegex::Grammar;
        use Pegex::AST;
        my $grammar = Pegex::Grammar->new(
            grammar => $grammar,
            receiver => Pegex::AST->new(),
        );
        $grammar->parse($input, 'rule_name');
        my $data = $grammar->receiver->data;

    or customized explicitly:

        package MyGrammar;
        use Pegex::Grammar -base;
        has grammar_text => "some grammar text goes here";

        package MyReceiver;
        use Pegex::Receiver -base;
        got_some_rule { ... }
        got_other_rule { ... }

        package main;
        use MyReceiver;
        use MyGrammar;
        my $receiver = MyReceiver->new();
        my $grammar = MyGrammar->new(
            receiver => $receiver,
        );
        $grammar->parse($input);
        my $data = $receiver->data;

DESCRIPTION
    Pegex is a Acmeist parser framework. It is a PEG parser grammar syntax,
    combined with PCRE compatible regular expressions as the match tokens.
    Pegex draws heavily from Perl 6 rules, but works equivalently in many
    modern programming languages.

    With Pegex you can easily define new mini languages that can be easily
    compiled in many programming languages.

A REAL WORLD EXAMPLE
    TestML is a new Acmeist unit test language. It is perfect for software
    that needs to run equivalently in more than one language.

    TestML has a language specification grammar:
    http://www.testml.org/specification/language/

    The Perl6 implementation of TestML uses this grammar in:
    http://github.com/ingydotnet/testml-pm6/blob/master/lib/TestML/Parser/Gr
    ammar.pm

    All other implementations of TestML use this Pegex grammar:
    http://github.com/ingydotnet/testml-pgx/blob/master/testml.pgx

    In Perl 5, Pegex::Compiler is used to compile the grammar into this
    simple data structure (shown in YAML):
    http://github.com/ingydotnet/testml-pgx/blob/master/grammar.yaml

    The grammar can also be precompiled to JSON:
    http://github.com/ingydotnet/testml-pgx/blob/master/grammar.json

    Pegex::Compiler further compiles this into a Perl 5 only graamar tree,
    which becomes this module:
    http://github.com/ingydotnet/testml-pm/blob/master/lib/TestML/Parser/Gra
    mmar.pm

    TestML::Parser::Grammar is a subclass of Pegex::Grammar. It can be used
    to parse TestML files. TestML::Parser calls the "parse()" method of the
    grammar with a TestML::Receiver object that receives callbacks when
    various rules match, and uses the information to build a
    TestML::Document object.
