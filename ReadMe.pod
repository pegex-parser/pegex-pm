Pegex - Acmeist PEG Parser Framework

=head1 Version

This document describes L<Pegex> version B<0.62>.

=head1 Synopsis

    use Pegex;
    my $result = pegex($grammar)->parse($input);

or with options:

    use Pegex;
    use ReceiverClass;
    my $parser = pegex($grammar, 'ReceiverClass');
    my $result = $parser->parse($input);

or more explicitly:

    use Pegex::Parser;
    use Pegex::Grammar;
    my $pegex_grammar = Pegex::Grammar->new(
        text => $grammar,
    );
    my $parser = Pegex::Parser->new(
        grammar => $pegex_grammar,
    );
    my $result = $parser->parse($input);

or customized explicitly:

    {
        package MyGrammar;
        use Pegex::Base;
        extends 'Pegex::Grammar';
        has text => "your grammar definition text goes here";
        has receiver => "MyReceiver";
    }
    {
        package MyReceiver;
        use base 'Pegex::Receiver';
        got_some_rule { ... }
        got_other_rule { ... }
    }
    use Pegex::Parser;
    my $parser = Pegex::Parser->new(
        grammar => MyGrammar->new,
        receiver => MyReceiver->new,
    );
    $parser->parse($input);
    my $result = $parser->receiver->data;

=head1 Description

Pegex is an Acmeist parser framework. It allows you to easily create parsers
that will work equivalently in lots of programming languages! The inspiration
for Pegex comes from the parsing engine upon which the postmodern programming
language B<Perl 6> is based on. Pegex brings this beauty to the other
I<just>modern languages that have a normal regular expression engine
available.

Pegex gets it name by combining Parsing Expression Grammars (PEG), with
Regular Expessions (Regex). That's actually what Pegex does.

PEG is the cool new way to elegantly specify recursive descent grammars. The
Perl 6 language is defined in terms of a self modifying PEG language called
B<Perl 6 Rules>. Regexes are familiar to programmers of most modern
programming languages. Pegex defines a simple PEG syntax, where all the
terminals are regexes. This means that Pegex can be quite fast and powerful.

Pegex attempts to be the simplest way to define new (or old) Domain Specific
Languages (DSLs) that need to be used in several programming languages and
environments. Things like JSON, YAML, Markdown etc. It also great for writing
parsers/compilers that only need to work in one language.

=head1 Usage

The C<Pegex.pm> module itself (this module) is just a trivial way to use the
Pegex framework. It is only intended for the simplest of uses.

This module exports a single function, C<pegex>, which takes a Pegex grammar
string as input. You may also pass a receiver class name after the grammar.

    my $parser = pegex($grammar, 'MyReceiver');

The C<pegex> function returns a L<Pegex::Parser> object, on which you would
typically call the C<parse()> method, which (on success) will return a data
structure of the parsed data.

See L<Pegex::API> for more details.

=head1 Pegex Debugging

Pegex (Pegex::Parser) has many easy to use methods of debugging. See the
"Debugging" section of L<Pegex::Parser> for details.
