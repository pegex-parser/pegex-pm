= Pegex Tutorials

Pegex has a growing number of tutorials on how to do various parsing tasks.

This document is just an index to the current tutorials.

- [Pegex::Tutorial::JSON]

  This is a very in-depth tutorial of the creation of the module [Pegex::JSON]
  (a JSON decoder that uses Pegex) and the thought that went into creating it.
  It covers almost all of the [Pegex::Syntax] as well.

- [Pegex::Tutorial::Calculator]

  Pegex comes with an `eg/` directory. One example is
  [Pegex/eg/calculator/calculator1.pl]. It's a simple precedence parser (and
  evaluator) for arithmetic expressions like this one:

    1 * (2 + 3) / (4 ^ 5 ^ 6 - -7)
